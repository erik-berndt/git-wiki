# Branching

> HEAD is a pointer to the active branch (points on the latest commit by default).   
Commits are made (and shown) depending on where HEAD is pointing at.

List branches:  
**$ git branch**

Create new branch:  
**$ git branch new_branch**

Switch to branch:  
**$ git switch branch_name** *(formerly git checkout branch_name)*
